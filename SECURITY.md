## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Preferred method:** Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-python/security/advisories/new) (click **Report a vulnerability**). This allows us to discuss and fix the issue before it is disclosed publicly.

**What we will do:**

- We will acknowledge your report and work with you to understand and address the issue.
- We will keep you informed about the status of the fix and will credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) once the issue is resolved.

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs. Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
